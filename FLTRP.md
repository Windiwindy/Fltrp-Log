### Economics
#### Comparative advantage
- Definition: A person has a comparative advantage at producing something if he can produce it at lower cost than anyone else. (cost: opportunity cost) The law of comparative advantage is popularly attributed to English political economist David Ricardo.
- explanation: The magic of comparative advantage is that everyone has a comparative advantage at producing something. The upshot is quite extraordinary: Everyone stands to gain from trade. Even those who are disadvantaged at every task still have something valuable to offer. The result will benefit the whole.
- eg1: for example, in the past few years India has become a major supplier of phone-answering services for the American market, even though their English-language skills are not up-to-par.
- eg2: Consider a famous athlete like Michael Jordan. Michael Jordan would likely be able to, say, paint his house quickly, owing to his abilities as well as his impressive height. Hypothetically, say that Michael Jordan could paint his house in 8 hours. In those same 8 hours, though, he could also take part in the filming of a television commercial which would earn him $50,000. By contrast, Jordan's neighbor Joe could paint the house in 10 hours. In that same period of time, he could work at a fast food restaurant and earn $100. In this example, Joe has a comparative advantage, even though Michael Jordan could paint the house faster and better. The best trade would be for Michael Jordan to film a television commercial and pay Joe to paint his house. So long as Michael Jordan makes the expected $50,000 and Joe earns more than $100, **the trade is a winner. Owing to their diversity of skills, Michael Jordan and Joe would likely find this to be the best arrangement for their mutual benefit.**
- my eg: In teamwork of reporting, even though I'm not as proficient as my collegues at every task, I could still focus on collecting the voices of young people and to provide my own value, which would allow for higher levels of value production by organizing labor more efficiently.
#### Efficiency and fairness
- opinion: There's consideration of efficiency behind fairness. No contradiction between the two.
- source: Haslem v. Lockwood, After Haslem found horse manure scattered on a public highway, he hired workers to collect it and left it gathered in piles on the public road overnight in order to remove it the next morning. Before Haslem returned, Lockwood removed it. Haslem sued. The thing is, how the case will influence the later generations. To award Haslem the manure, is to encourage people creating wealth, and to show that law protects this wealth even if no efforts are made to protect it. The efforts for protecting property rights is a resouce consumption, law and ethics help reduce the consumption and improve efficiency.
- eg123: put people into jail - positive accumulation of human capital; steal other people's property - care for our own wealth; hold the road troublemakers accountable - promote the efficiency of the public roads
my eg: miss the deadline and fail - ensure the healthy development of rule consciousness
#### What is seen and what is not seen (opportunity cost)
- opinion: when we make decisions, we need to consider those factors which could not be seen - use imagination
- def of opportunity cost: Opportunity costs represent the benefits an individual, investor or business **misses out/give up** on when choosing one alternative over another./foregone alternatives
- source: 
  - http://bastiat.org/en/twisatwins.html#SECTION_G001
  - *That Which is Seen, and That Which is Not Seen* by Frédéric Bastiat, THE BROKEN WINDOW - it is a good thing to break windows, that the glazier's trade is encouraged, it causes money to circulate, and that the encouragement of industry in general will be the result of it. But it is not seen that as our shopkeeper has spent six francs upon one thing, he cannot spend them upon another. It is not seen that if he had not had a window to replace, he would, perhaps, have replaced his old shoes, or added another book to his library.
- eg: country development: Germany underwent WWII and Japan suffered from Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings, and therefore they developed quickly thereafter. The catastrophe is not the necessary condition for prosperity.
#### Sunk cost
- def: A sunk cost refers to money that has already been spent and which cannot be recovered.
- exp: We are emotional with our purchases and we factor old memories when we make new decisions. But because these costs cannot be retrieved, they should not factor at all into future financial decisions. 
- eg: Maybe you bought the ticket long in advance but realized too late that you have an exam the next morning, and need to spend that night studying and getting your rest. But $30 is a lot of money for a broke college student like yourself, so you decide to get your money's worth and attend the concert anyway. Regardless of whether you go to the concert or not, the $30 isn't getting recouped.
#### Marginal cost and marginal revenue
- def: Marginal refers to the added cost or profit earned with producing the next unit. Marginal Cost is the increase in cost by producing one more unit of the good. Marginal Revenue is the change in total revenue as a result of changing the rate of sales by one unit.
- exp: The profit maximization formula is MC = MR. If a company's marginal revenue is less than the marginal cost of producing more units, it's an indication that the company is producing too much. On the other hand, if a company's marginal revenue is greater than its marginal cost, it indicates that the company is not producing enough units.
- eg: make rational decisions, for example, once a movie is being shown at a movie theater, the marginal cost for the movie theater of having one more person watching the movie is zero as long as the movie has not sold out, because the costs incurred by the theater for each time it actually runs the film are not affected by the number of people in the theater.

### Outline of the Cube and the Ball
#### What is love
Central idea: Love is not about changing blindly, but changing for the better

1. Changing blindly causes self-abasement and imbalance in the relationship. 
·	Using others’ criteria to judge yourself, there will be no end for 100% changing because we are in the wrong evaluation system, which leads to self-abasement.
·	Love is like a scale. One-side changing makes it imbalanced and destroys the relationship. It’s mutual giving and compromise.
2. Love is about changing for the better
·	The truth is, in love we all change. We change because we are different. We appreciate each other’s shinning points, and stretch the breadth of our life. Change to be a tolerant, caring and considerate partner. 
·	In love, we have a common direction. The direction does not lead you to the other half, but together forward. 

#### From love to the broader perspective
Central idea: Do not change yourself, because eventually you are living for yourself.

1. Don’t change yourself for love
·	Our natural insecurities can make us feel that we are unworthy of love, that if we can only change ourselves to be more beautiful, more interesting, more...something, we’ll finally find the relationships we want. 
·	But Love is an acknowledgement, acceptance, and appreciation of the other person’s nature. We need to be loved, because we want this acknowledgement that we are needed, and we are valuable.
·	Changing is a denial, which makes you feel vulnerable and self-disparaging. We do not live for love but love to live a better life. We do not live for an inferior self, but a better self.

2. It’s also true with life.
·	It’s not only with love, but also with other people and the society we live in. We are living in an era where criteria are influenced by mass media, advertisement, consumption stimulus. They change rapidly, which would leave you tired and miserable. Like pairs of shackles.
·	We need to change critically. Life is about becoming the best version of yourself, not someone else. When we lie in our coffins and look back, we may ask who we are living for?

#### Think from the other side
Central message: The efforts of the cube are appreciated, but after so many changes, there needs to be a time when we ask ourselves, what kind of person we want to become. 

1. The cube is a reflection each and everyone of us, and there are certainly positive sides.
·	We are changing ourselves everyday for this world, to make ourselves more considerate for the ones we love, to train ourselves to become more competent for the career we pursue. 
·	It’s really brave and sincere, that we are seeking for the better, and proactive enough to make changes. Def way better than just sitting in the couch and complaining.

2. Facing so much adversity, it’s also a time for us to pause, and begin a new journey.
·	Facing setbacks in a row, we might stop for a while. Ask ourselves: does it really fit me? What kind of person I want to become?
·	Having been through so much, we have come to know ourselves better, accept ourselves better and love ourselves better. With this better knowledge and experience, we could form a new and more sincere version of ourselves.

### 1. The Black Hole
- to have a clear and strong central message 
  - When facing new technologies, first we have to learn how to use it: nuclear power
  - Presented with infinite opportunities, we lost ourselves because we don't know what we want
- to accommodate the audience with mentioning the video

### 2. Cube and Ball
- to have a clear and strong central message
- be cautious with examples, they are to support the central message, do not scatter everywhere
- sometimes to change a perspective
  - actually the cube is really sincere and interesting. He is constantly making efforts to adapt to the other he loves. He is a real person in the society, and has a positive side. But sometimes after we have tried so much, we might want to ask ourselves, what kind of person we want to become. It is also a new start for the cube - with a better knowledge of himself.
- what is your attitude towards love, education, family 
- slogans have to be integrated to your own feelings and opinions
- start from the video (love) to the broad perspective
