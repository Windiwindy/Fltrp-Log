### Journalism
#### 拉斯韦尔5W "5W" communication model by Harold Lasswell, a linear model
- Who,	the communicator or sender or source of message,	Control Analysis
- Says What,	the content of the message,	Content Analysis
- In Which Channel,	the medium or media,	Media Analysis
- To Whom,	the receiver of the message or an audience,	Audience Analysis
- With What Effect,	the feedback of the receiver to the sender,	Effect Analysis **know your audience**
- eg: CNN NEWS – A water leak from Japan’s tsunami-crippled nuclear power station resulted in about 100 times the permitted level of radioactive material flowing into the sea, operator Tokyo Electric Power Co said on Saturday.
- eg: to write stories that my mother could understand
#### 韦斯特利-麦克莱恩 Westley and MacLean’s Model of Communication
- There is the concept of feedback. This model can be seen two contexts, interpersonal and mass communication. And the point of difference between interpersonal and mass communication is the feedback. In interpersonal, the feedback is direct and fast. In the mass, the feedback is indirect and slow.
#### 把关人理论 gate-keeping
- def: Gatekeeping as a theory, is the news selection and extraction of news, which then gets passed through a series of gates (the journalists), and gets transformed and ends up in the news.
- exp: Gatekeepers ultimately craft and conduct what is being published to the masses, therefore they determine what is to become the public’s social reality, and their view of the world.
- challenges: In recent years, there has been blurred lines between establishing who the media audiences are and who the journalists are in today’s society. Due to social media jumping the gates, and with the wide range of accessibility, the differences between public opinions and what is journalistic news is made indistinct.
#### 第三人效果 the third-person effect
- def: The third-person effect hypothesis predicts that people tend to perceive that mass media messages have a greater effect on others than on themselves, based on personal biases.
#### 沉默的螺旋 spiral of silence
- def: the tendence of people to remain silent when they feel that their views are in opposition to the majority view on a subject. 
- exp: The theory posits that they remain silent for a few reasons including fear of isolation when the group or public realizes that the individual has a divergent opinion from the status quo, and fear of reprisal or more extreme isolation (loss of a job, status, etc.)
- eg: In political elections, usually people are asked about their thoughts on candidates. They try to support the popular candidate confidently or do not give out their opinions. This explains the theory.
#### 信息茧房 Information Cocoons
- def: A lot of people love reading things that fortify and confirm their own opinions — and, by definition, people like reading about topics that interest them. So, freedom of choice can produce self-sorting, in which people enter echo chambers or information cocoons.
- exp: We’re becoming more isolated from a diversity of opinions and information and more closely connected to a homogenous cohort.
- my eg: weibo following travel bloggers, I was fielding a torrent of weibo from "the travel when you are young" reaffirming my pre-existing worldview.
#### 知沟理论 knowledge-gap theory
- def: the infusion of mass media information into a social system increases higher socioeconomic status segments tend to acquire this information faster than lower socioeconomic status population segments. Hence  the  gap in knowledge between the two tends to increase rather than decrease.
- reasons: 
  - Communication Skills– As a person receives more education, his communication skill increases and hence gathering information becomes easier for him. reading, understanding and memory skills
  - educated person is exposed to much more topics; Relevant Social Contact; Selective Exposure
#### fake news
- types: sensational headlines; propaganda stories; parody like The Onion; sloppy journalism due to carelessness of journalists, writing with sources unchecked, etc.
- journalists and media outlets that are required to follow strict codes of practice, eg, Readers Magazine
- critical thinking and media literacy is essential
#### 麦克卢汉 Marshall McLuhan
**The medium is the message**
- def: the way that we send and receive information is more important than the information itself.
- exp: 媒介本身的存在改变了人类认知世界、感受世界和以行为影响世界的方式，而媒介传递的内容信息与媒介本身对人类社会发展带来的影响相比，则是相对次要的。麦克卢汉则更加重视“手机”这个媒介本身对人与社会的整体影响，比如手机的出现，让“低头族”变多、人们的内容获取更为零散，由此导致思维的碎片化，整个社会的发展都朝向“移动化”转变。这就是内容和形式的差别。如果说内容带来的是短效的态度转变，形式更多的是长期性的宏观变化。麦克卢汉指出，印刷术出现之后导致西方理性文明发展，电视出现之后带来人与社会的巨大转变，主导这一切的是形式而非内容，因此媒介本身才是对社会变迁带来深刻变化的主体——媒介即讯息。
- eg:  The media have changed the way we behave. Studies have shown that our memory spans have reduced due to digital technology. News stories have been replaced with 140 character weibos. Conversations have been replaced with emojis.

**Media as Extensions of man**
- McLuhan calls media as the extensions of man, as they each increase the **power and range** of one part of the human body. From the premise that media, or technologies are extensions of some physical, social, psychological, or intellectual function of humans, flows all of McLuhan’s subsequent ideas. Thus, the wheel extends our feet, the phone extends our voice, television extends our eyes and ears, the computer extends our brain, and electronic media, in general, extend our central nervous system. （电子媒介是中枢神经系统的延伸）
- language too is a medium or technology because it is an extension, or outering, of our inner thoughts, ideas, and feelings—that is, an extension of inner consciousness. eg. public speaking.

### Economics
#### Comparative advantage
- Definition: A person has a comparative advantage at producing something if he can produce it at lower cost than anyone else. (cost: opportunity cost) The law of comparative advantage is popularly attributed to English political economist David Ricardo.
- explanation: The magic of comparative advantage is that everyone has a comparative advantage at producing something. The upshot is quite extraordinary: Everyone stands to gain from trade. Even those who are disadvantaged at every task still have something valuable to offer. The result will benefit the whole.
- eg1: for example, in the past few years India has become a major supplier of phone-answering services for the American market, even though their English-language skills are not up-to-par.
- eg2: Consider a famous athlete like Michael Jordan. Michael Jordan would likely be able to, say, paint his house quickly, owing to his abilities as well as his impressive height. Hypothetically, say that Michael Jordan could paint his house in 8 hours. In those same 8 hours, though, he could also take part in the filming of a television commercial which would earn him $50,000. By contrast, Jordan's neighbor Joe could paint the house in 10 hours. In that same period of time, he could work at a fast food restaurant and earn $100. In this example, Joe has a comparative advantage, even though Michael Jordan could paint the house faster and better. The best trade would be for Michael Jordan to film a television commercial and pay Joe to paint his house. So long as Michael Jordan makes the expected $50,000 and Joe earns more than $100, **the trade is a winner. Owing to their diversity of skills, Michael Jordan and Joe would likely find this to be the best arrangement for their mutual benefit.**
- my eg: In teamwork of reporting, even though I'm not as proficient as my collegues at every task, I could still focus on collecting the voices of young people and to provide my own value, which would allow for higher levels of value production by organizing labor more efficiently.
#### Efficiency and fairness
- opinion: There's consideration of efficiency behind fairness. No contradiction between the two.
- source: Haslem v. Lockwood, After Haslem found horse manure scattered on a public highway, he hired workers to collect it and left it gathered in piles on the public road overnight in order to remove it the next morning. Before Haslem returned, Lockwood removed it. Haslem sued. The thing is, how the case will influence the later generations. To award Haslem the manure, is to encourage people creating wealth, and to show that law protects this wealth even if no efforts are made to protect it. The efforts for protecting property rights is a resouce consumption, law and ethics help reduce the consumption and improve efficiency.
- eg123: put people into jail - positive accumulation of human capital; steal other people's property - care for our own wealth; hold the road troublemakers accountable - promote the efficiency of the public roads
my eg: miss the deadline and fail - ensure the healthy development of rule consciousness
#### What is seen and what is not seen (opportunity cost)
- opinion: when we make decisions, we need to consider those factors which could not be seen - use imagination
- def of opportunity cost: Opportunity costs represent the benefits an individual, investor or business **misses out/give up** on when choosing one alternative over another./foregone alternatives
- source: 
  - http://bastiat.org/en/twisatwins.html#SECTION_G001
  - *That Which is Seen, and That Which is Not Seen* by Frédéric Bastiat, THE BROKEN WINDOW - it is a good thing to break windows, that the glazier's trade is encouraged, it causes money to circulate, and that the encouragement of industry in general will be the result of it. But it is not seen that as our shopkeeper has spent six francs upon one thing, he cannot spend them upon another. It is not seen that if he had not had a window to replace, he would, perhaps, have replaced his old shoes, or added another book to his library.
- eg: country development: Germany underwent WWII and Japan suffered from Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings, and therefore they developed quickly thereafter. The catastrophe is not the necessary condition for prosperity.
#### Sunk cost
- def: A sunk cost refers to money that has already been spent and which cannot be recovered.
- exp: We are emotional with our purchases and we factor old memories when we make new decisions. But because these costs cannot be retrieved, they should not factor at all into future financial decisions. 
- eg: Maybe you bought the ticket long in advance but realized too late that you have an exam the next morning, and need to spend that night studying and getting your rest. But $30 is a lot of money for a broke college student like yourself, so you decide to get your money's worth and attend the concert anyway. Regardless of whether you go to the concert or not, the $30 isn't getting recouped.
#### Marginal cost and marginal revenue
- def: Marginal refers to the added cost or profit earned with producing the next unit. Marginal Cost is the increase in cost by producing one more unit of the good. Marginal Revenue is the change in total revenue as a result of changing the rate of sales by one unit.
- exp: The profit maximization formula is MC = MR. If a company's marginal revenue is less than the marginal cost of producing more units, it's an indication that the company is producing too much. On the other hand, if a company's marginal revenue is greater than its marginal cost, it indicates that the company is not producing enough units.
- eg: make rational decisions, for example, once a movie is being shown at a movie theater, the marginal cost for the movie theater of having one more person watching the movie is zero as long as the movie has not sold out, because the costs incurred by the theater for each time it actually runs the film are not affected by the number of people in the theater.

### TOPIC - FAMILY
#### 1. More your parents’ social capital, economic capital and cultural capital, the more likely you will have a better-off life. (From the angle of sociology)
- My eg: Is working hard enough to get yourself into top2? Why are you the person sitting in the classroom? On the first sociological class I’ve ever taken in college, a questionnaire with questions: What’s your parents’ occupation? What’s your phone model? What's the furthest journey you've ever made before college? “Your family background decides your resources, your study environment, your primary school, junior school and high school, your vision and your horizon. You are sitting here, not only because of your efforts, but also things mentioned above.”
- Matthew effect: Whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them.
- 7 Up to 63 Up: documentary series with an original premise of asking whether or not our adult lives are pre-determined by our earliest influences and the social class in which we are raised, Andrew who read the Financial Times at 7 now a successful lawyer, yet farmer’s son Nick now a professor
- British birth cohort studies: It all starts back in 1946. More than 70,000 children have been involved in these studies across those five generations, data collected includes DNA, cost on milk and corsets by moms. Many children in this study were born into poor families or into working-class families that had cramped homes or other problems, and it's clear now that those disadvantaged children have been more likely to struggle on almost every score.
#### 2. parents - good parenting/self - efforts/govt - carefully designed systems would beat the odds and overcome some of those early disadvantages.
- Parents: Talking and listening to a child, responding to them warmly, teaching them their letters and numbers, taking them on trips and visits. Reading to children every day seems to be really important, too. Putting them to bed on time: data showed that those children who were going to bed at different times were more likely to have behavioral problems. Encouragement. The Pygmalion effect.
- Self: The first lesson for successful life, everyone, is this: choose your parents very carefully - I'm sure you can see the small problem here. We can't choose our parents or how much they earn. We are x-raying the reasons, but we are not blaming our family because we have the ability to change our situations.
- Cultural capital comprises the social assets of a person that promote social mobility in a stratified society. Examples of cultural capital would include knowledge, skills, and education. Pierre Bourdieu.
- Govt: College entrance examination
#### 3. The role of parental influence on children 's personality (psychologically)
- Opening: A human doesn’t enter into the world with a fully formed personality springing forth from their genes. Rather, babies enter the world with a temperament — or the raw material of personality — that is sculpted into personality by experiences in the world: at school, with friends and siblings, and, perhaps most of all, by their parents.
- When a child fails to grow a strong attachment to their parents, the lack of inner security cannot be eliminated as he gets older/Lack of love leads to lack of ego strength. Ego strength helps us maintain emotional stability and cope with internal and external stress. Solution: self-observation, reading literature, seeking assistance.
- There’s only one type of life force. When it is seen, it would become positive: passion, curiosity, love. When it is ignored, it would become a dark force: hatred, attack, destruction.
- Authoritarian – procrastinator, Be authoritative and not authoritarian, this means that you must set rules but in the same time be democratic enough to explain to your child the reason behind these rules when possible.
#### 4. Kids should be taught to treat others the way they want to be treated, because they learn from what goes on around them and by how they and other family members interact and are treated.
- Children are equal to adults in deserving respect as human beings. That doesn’t mean they’re the same as adults. Tall people and short people are equal under the law but that doesn’t mean short people don’t need a stool to reach a high place. Children lack the experience and emotional maturity of adults. They see the world differently. They’re born with the capacity to figure out how the world works. But we need to give them the opportunities to try out their wonky ideas and learn from what happens.
- A second very important finding from the Harvard Grant Study said that happiness in life comes from love, not love of work, love of humans: our spouse, our partner, our friends, our family. So childhood needs to teach our kids how to love, and they can't love others if they don't first love themselves, and they won't love themselves if we can't offer them unconditional love.
#### 5. the difference between a lover's love and family's love
- Storge is fondness through familiarity (a brotherly love), especially between family members or people who have otherwise found themselves together by chance.
- Philia is the love between friends.
- Eros is the sensation of 'being in love' or 'loving' someone, as opposed to the raw sexuality.
- Agape is the love that brings forth caring regardless of the circumstances.
- Storge+Agape
- Philia+Eros
#### 6. Parent and adolescent grow up in a different historical time and culture. Generation gap is a production of normal social change.
- It is not only that parents are no longer a guide, but that there are no guides. (Margaret Mead) They are immigrants in time, immigrants from an earlier world.
- They watch the source of power, the means of communication, the definition of humanity, the limits of their explorable universe, the certainties of a known and limited world all change before their eyes.
- In my day: Children rarely want to know who their parents were before they were parents
- To the degree that parents can bridge the generational difference by showing an interest in the new, this can reduce the gap's potentially estranging influence; treat the adolescent as an “expert” and themselves as "unknowing"
- ambivalence = affective solidarity+ conflicts
- Accept that your parents may not understand you. Communicate, and introduce yourself.
#### 7. One is eventually to leave the family or say farewell, no matter how reluctant, you are the one responsible for yourself.
- My grandma has pancreatic cancer. You have to go.
#### 8. A family is a condensed version of the world. A person is a condensed version of a family. A Kaleidoscope of Human Affairs

### TOPIC - EDUCTAION (TKTK)
#### 1. no significant learning can occur without a significant relationship
-	she left a legacy of relationships that could never disappear.
#### 2. Online education – Is MOOC going to replace universities?
- e-learning and the traditional classroom will one day form a union: compensating for one where the other lacks.
- E-learning: by removing the one-size-fits-all lecture from the classroom, and letting students have a self-paced lecture at home
- The purpose of university education: (vs technical school) enlighten and self-education; gain a liberal perspective (willing to understand and respect); enlargement of your intellectual horizon + specialization
#### 3. Involution – vicious competition – solutions?
#### 4. social function

### 对答如流
- King John, to gild refined gold, to paint the lily, to throw a perfume on the violet...is wasteful and ridiculous excess
- 无事不登三宝殿，三宝：佛、法（教法）、僧，buddha, buddhist teachings, monk
- he's got cold feet = fearful of doing something
-

### Outline of the Cube and the Ball
#### What is love
Central idea: Love is not about changing blindly, but changing for the better

1. Changing blindly causes self-abasement and imbalance in the relationship. 
·	Using others’ criteria to judge yourself, there will be no end for 100% changing because we are in the wrong evaluation system, which leads to self-abasement.
·	Love is like a scale. One-side changing makes it imbalanced and destroys the relationship. It’s mutual giving and compromise.
2. Love is about changing for the better
·	The truth is, in love we all change. We change because we are different. We appreciate each other’s shinning points, and stretch the breadth of our life. Change to be a tolerant, caring and considerate partner. 
·	In love, we have a common direction. The direction does not lead you to the other half, but together forward. 

#### From love to the broader perspective
Central idea: Do not change yourself, because eventually you are living for yourself.

1. Don’t change yourself for love
·	Our natural insecurities can make us feel that we are unworthy of love, that if we can only change ourselves to be more beautiful, more interesting, more...something, we’ll finally find the relationships we want. 
·	But Love is an acknowledgement, acceptance, and appreciation of the other person’s nature. We need to be loved, because we want this acknowledgement that we are needed, and we are valuable.
·	Changing is a denial, which makes you feel vulnerable and self-disparaging. We do not live for love but love to live a better life. We do not live for an inferior self, but a better self.

2. It’s also true with life.
·	It’s not only with love, but also with other people and the society we live in. We are living in an era where criteria are influenced by mass media, advertisement, consumption stimulus. They change rapidly, which would leave you tired and miserable. Like pairs of shackles.
·	We need to change critically. Life is about becoming the best version of yourself, not someone else. When we lie in our coffins and look back, we may ask who we are living for?

#### Think from the other side
Central message: The efforts of the cube are appreciated, but after so many changes, there needs to be a time when we ask ourselves, what kind of person we want to become. 

1. The cube is a reflection each and everyone of us, and there are certainly positive sides.
·	We are changing ourselves everyday for this world, to make ourselves more considerate for the ones we love, to train ourselves to become more competent for the career we pursue. 
·	It’s really brave and sincere, that we are seeking for the better, and proactive enough to make changes. Def way better than just sitting in the couch and complaining.

2. Facing so much adversity, it’s also a time for us to pause, and begin a new journey.
·	Facing setbacks in a row, we might stop for a while. Ask ourselves: does it really fit me? What kind of person I want to become?
·	Having been through so much, we have come to know ourselves better, accept ourselves better and love ourselves better. With this better knowledge and experience, we could form a new and more sincere version of ourselves.

### 1. The Black Hole
- to have a clear and strong central message 
  - When facing new technologies, first we have to learn how to use it: nuclear power
  - Presented with infinite opportunities, we lost ourselves because we don't know what we want
- to accommodate the audience with mentioning the video

### 2. Cube and Ball
- to have a clear and strong central message
- be cautious with examples, they are to support the central message, do not scatter everywhere
- sometimes to change a perspective
  - actually the cube is really sincere and interesting. He is constantly making efforts to adapt to the other he loves. He is a real person in the society, and has a positive side. But sometimes after we have tried so much, we might want to ask ourselves, what kind of person we want to become. It is also a new start for the cube - with a better knowledge of himself.
- what is your attitude towards love, education, family 
- slogans have to be integrated to your own feelings and opinions
- start from the video (love) to the broad perspective
