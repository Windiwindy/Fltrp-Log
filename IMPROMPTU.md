### Outline of the Cube and the Ball
#### What is love
Central idea: Love is not about changing blindly, but changing for the better

1. Changing blindly causes self-abasement and imbalance in the relationship. 
·	Using others’ criteria to judge yourself, there will be no end for 100% changing because we are in the wrong evaluation system, which leads to self-abasement.
·	Love is like a scale. One-side changing makes it imbalanced and destroys the relationship. It’s mutual giving and compromise.
2. Love is about changing for the better
·	The truth is, in love we all change. We change because we are different. We appreciate each other’s shinning points, and stretch the breadth of our life. Change to be a tolerant, caring and considerate partner. 
·	In love, we have a common direction. The direction does not lead you to the other half, but together forward. 

#### From love to the broader perspective
Central idea: Do not change yourself, because eventually you are living for yourself.

1. Don’t change yourself for love
·	Our natural insecurities can make us feel that we are unworthy of love, that if we can only change ourselves to be more beautiful, more interesting, more...something, we’ll finally find the relationships we want. 
·	But Love is an acknowledgement, acceptance, and appreciation of the other person’s nature. We need to be loved, because we want this acknowledgement that we are needed, and we are valuable.
·	Changing is a denial, which makes you feel vulnerable and self-disparaging. We do not live for love but love to live a better life. We do not live for an inferior self, but a better self.

2. It’s also true with life.
·	It’s not only with love, but also with other people and the society we live in. We are living in an era where criteria are influenced by mass media, advertisement, consumption stimulus. They change rapidly, which would leave you tired and miserable. Like pairs of shackles.
·	We need to change critically. Life is about becoming the best version of yourself, not someone else. When we lie in our coffins and look back, we may ask who we are living for?

#### Think from the other side
Central message: The efforts of the cube are appreciated, but after so many changes, there needs to be a time when we ask ourselves, what kind of person we want to become. 

1. The cube is a reflection each and everyone of us, and there are certainly positive sides.
·	We are changing ourselves everyday for this world, to make ourselves more considerate for the ones we love, to train ourselves to become more competent for the career we pursue. 
·	It’s really brave and sincere, that we are seeking for the better, and proactive enough to make changes. Def way better than just sitting in the couch and complaining.

2. Facing so much adversity, it’s also a time for us to pause, and begin a new journey.
·	Facing setbacks in a row, we might stop for a while. Ask ourselves: does it really fit me? What kind of person I want to become?
·	Having been through so much, we have come to know ourselves better, accept ourselves better and love ourselves better. With this better knowledge and experience, we could form a new and more sincere version of ourselves.

### 1. The Black Hole
- to have a clear and strong central message 
  - When facing new technologies, first we have to learn how to use it: nuclear power
  - Presented with infinite opportunities, we lost ourselves because we don't know what we want
- to accommodate the audience with mentioning the video

### 2. Cube and Ball
- to have a clear and strong central message
- be cautious with examples, they are to support the central message, do not scatter everywhere
- sometimes to change a perspective
  - actually the cube is really sincere and interesting. He is constantly making efforts to adapt to the other he loves. He is a real person in the society, and has a positive side. But sometimes after we have tried so much, we might want to ask ourselves, what kind of person we want to become. It is also a new start for the cube - with a better knowledge of himself.
- what is your attitude towards love, education, family 
- slogans have to be integrated to your own feelings and opinions
- start from the video (love) to the broad perspective
